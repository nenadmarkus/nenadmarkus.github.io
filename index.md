# Nenad Markuš

I am a computer-vision engineer/scientist living in Zagreb, Croatia.

In the past, I was employed as a teaching/research assistant at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](http://fer.unizg.hr/) (part of the University of Zagreb).
Nowadays, I work for [Microblink Ltd.](https://microblink.com/)

This website contains basic info about myself, my research interests and links to some of my projects.

Enjoy your stay.

## Research

During my university years, I did research, R&D and consulting in the following areas of computer vision:

* face analysis (face tracking, eye pupil localization, gender/age estimation, etc.);
* real-time object detection;
* non-photorealistic rendering (image mosaics, ASCII art);
* learning local descriptors for keypoint matching and image recognition;
* neural networks and deep learning in general.

Currently, I mainly work on problems in vision-based document processing/recognition/retrieval on mobile platforms, which is all related to my current employment.

However, I am interested in a variety of topics in machine learning and computer vision, and plan to do research in these areas as well.
